        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>After trying (and failing) to manage 5+ <strike>Twitter</strike> X roleplay accounts at once, and after getting locked out of my primary RP account because Twitter is going to hell, I decided to start from scratch with a new account.</p>
        <p>And then I got so sick of <strike>Twitter</strike> X <a href="https://x.com/BornOfVelocity/status/1843380028849217694">that it was enough to make me leave entirely</a>, and so I decided to <strong>really</strong> start from scratch.</p>
        <p>Born Of Velocity encapsulates all characters I've ever roleplayed as, and all characters I plan to roleplay in the future. It's essentially an indefinitely large multimuse profile.</p>
        <p>This website will serve as an incomprehensive list of characters as well as a collection of short crossover headcanon-y stories written by myself.</p>
